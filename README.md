# Yoobic Ionic

## Description

This Project was made as a hiring test for Yoobic, it is a cross platform application made with Ionic and Angular. This was both my first Angular and my first Ionic application ever, but definitely wont be the last. It has been a great learning experience, and I am happy I was introduced to these technologies. Both Ionic and Angular is way more equipped than technologies of my main stack(P.E.R.N.), and I definitely understand why both of these technologies are so popular.
